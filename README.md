Notes and references for real estate investing

## How I got started
I ended up getting into real estate notes instead of property. I don't need to stress about maintenance, contractors, and tenants. Also, I entered the note space by acquiring partial notes from other note investors. My first partial was $10K for 10% for 5 years. My other partial cost $17K for 8.65% for 5 yrs. I get a paycheck every month and the notes are secured by residential property. The monthly payments follow an amortization schedule which means that a bigger portion of the monthly payments are towards interest. Both partial notes were purchased in my self directed IRA. 
What was important for me: 
1. costs less to enter the note space.
2. I could invest in partials via my IRA which already had the funds I needed vs having to save 20% down payment for an investment property. 
3. the headaches of owning investment property isn't there for a beginner like me with a full time job. 

My first few months in the space, I realized that education and building relationships was most important than trying to acquire a note right away.
